# ElevatorKata
These are some features. They can be implemented in any order you prefer.

For some Domain history look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storey for a better understanding

* Elevator responds to calls containing a source floor and returns a direction
* Elevator delivers passengers to requested floors
* Elevator should have an event that emits each floor as it passes the floor
* Elevator doesn't respond immediately. consider options to simulate time
* Elevator calls are queued not necessarily FIFO
* Validate passenger floor requests
* Implement current floor monitor
* Implement direction arrows
* You may implement doors (opening and closing)
* You may implement DING!
* The can be an elevator display panel that can command the elevator
* There can be an outside elevator display panel that can be responsible for calling an elevator and displaying which floor its on and which direction the lift is going in
* There can be more than one elevator inside a building
